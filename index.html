							<span>I</span> am still working on finding myself, and from what I've read of this book, the writing is great, resources

							<span>I</span> wanted something fun to read, and as a long time Splinter Cell fan I've always wanted to read this book.
							The writing of the first-person chapters bothers me constantly, but the book does provide and story and setting satisfying
							as a fan. Some of Fisher's internal thoughts seem a bit out of character, but that is probably of the character I
							imagined him to be, as the writer had to create himself.</p>
